          <p>
            Imagine AI not as something distant, but something you can speak to down the allotment, at the caf√©, in the youth centre. Mortal Swamp is cultivating community-led AI agents ‚Äî creative, ethical, and locally tuned to the rhythms of small cities and rural towns like Worcester and Bewdley.

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Agents run locally or in secure small-scale clouds, using open-source models</li>
            <li>They support creative collaboration, sustainability planning, and local knowledge archiving</li>
            <li>Each one is co-designed with community groups, artists, educators, or carers</li>

          <p>
            After COVID shifted the tempo of our lives, many of us are seeking slower, more connected, and resilient futures. I was born in 1993, and like many millennials, I&apos;ve spent the last decade exploring ways to work creatively with my community ‚Äî from Prince&rsquo;s Trust youth projects to designing tools for education, music, and access. This initiative brings that spirit forward, into a world that needs it more than ever.
